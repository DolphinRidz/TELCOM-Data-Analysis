# TELCOM-Data-Analysis
The analysis aims to understand the factors associated with customer churn for a telecommunications company, focusing on demographic, contract, and billing data to identify trends and potential areas for improving customer retention.
# Summary of Analysis
## Data Preparation:

The dataset was initially processed by converting TotalCharges from a string to a numeric format, replacing blank entries with 0 to handle missing data.
The SeniorCitizen column was converted to a binary representation of "Yes"/"No" for better readability.
Churn Analysis:

A count plot and pie chart were used to analyze churn distribution, revealing that approximately 26.54% of customers churned.
Customer churn is further broken down by gender, and senior citizen status is examined to assess any correlations.
Churn by Demographics:

Analyses included churn rates segmented by gender and age (with a specific focus on senior citizens). This highlights which customer groups are more likely to churn, which can help in targeting retention efforts.
Visualization Techniques:

Count plots, pie charts, and bar charts were used to represent distribution and proportion data visually. A stacked bar chart was also created to display churn percentages by senior citizen status.
